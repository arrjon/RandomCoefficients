# RandomCoefficients

This is a study project based on the paper  [Nonparametric Estimation of the Random Coefficients Model: 
An Elastic Net Approach](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407621000178) by Heiss et al. (2022).

The non-parametric elastic net estimator is implemented in python using the free software package for 
convex optimization [CVXOPT](https://cvxopt.org).
Further requirements are listed in the file `requirements.txt`.

A simulation study is performed on a mixed multinomial logit model for demand estimation.

Feel free to contribute to this project.
